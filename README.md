# Inventory Application

This app was created to manage items from the grocery. 

It allows the user to load their grocery items list to the app and within the app, the user can add, update or delete items. They can search for an item in the list and save changes to the initial file loaded. The user can also generate reports where they can get more information about the items and generate a shopping list for all items needed to be purchased.
